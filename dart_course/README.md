# Dart: The Complete Developer's Guide (Zero To Mastery)

Course available [here](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/learn-dart) and source code available [here](https://github.com/bizz84/dart-course-materials).

## Note

Some of the concepts are very similar to other programming languages I already know, such as C, Java and JavaScript, so I just saved some specific examples for personal reference.
